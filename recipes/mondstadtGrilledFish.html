        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mondstadt Grilled Fish is a food item that the player can cook. The recipe for Mondstadt Grilled Fish is available from the start of the game.
        Depending on the quality, Mondstadt Grilled Fish revives and restores 50/100/150 HP to the target fallen character with a 120-second cooldown. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in Co-Op Mode.
        When Diona cooks Mondstadt Grilled Fish, there is a chance Definitely Not Bar Food! will be created instead. </p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 to 1 and 1/2 lb of Skin-on Salmon fillet, cut into 1-2 inch cubes / approximate pieces.</li>
            <li>Wooden or Metal Skewers (We used 15 – if wooden, pre-soak in water for 30 minutes)</li>
            <li>1 small green cabbage (we’re not going to be using a lot of it, so a half would suffice)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Marinade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbs Oyster Sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbs Sesame Oil</li>
            <li>1 tbs honey</li>
            <li>1/2 tps of black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsp of Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbs of House of Tsang Szechuan Spicy Stir-Fry Sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>After your salmon has been cubed accordingly, bring the marinade ingredients together in a bowl large enough to stir them together and gently coat your salmon in the marinade, letting it soak in the flavor for half an hour.</li>
            <li>While you’re doing that, pre-heat your oven to 375. You’ll want a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil, and if you have one, a wire rack. You can do these on a grill, though, and if you decide to do so, you should shoot for medium heat if you have a temperature control.</li>
            <li>Cut the cabbage (or other appropriate grilling / baking greenery, such as multiple pieces of butter lettuce, multiple pieces of spinach) to the approximate size of your fish so you can wrap strips around themselves and pierce into a package later on. (If you’d prefer thin pieces, you can cut squares or rounds instead of strips.)</li>
            <li>Assemble your skewers; the pattern we used is Salmon, Leaf, Salmon, Leaf, Salmon–like in the game. Please keep in mind that your greens are likely to char, leafy vegetables aren’t often subjected to grilling / extended oven baking.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes / Grill for 8-10, you’re looking for an internal temp around 145 per FDA regulations, but because this IS fish, as long as you’ve gotten it fresh from a trusted market, then just as we have salmon raw in many applications, it’s okay if it’s a bit underdone. But I promise you, fully cooked, this will be delicious! Let it rest for a few minutes, then plate up and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
